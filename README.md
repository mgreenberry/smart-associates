## About

I created this interactive website to provide a professional and simple website for a Civil and Structural Engineering company I work for.

The website targets customers and clients that would require the use of a civil and/or structural engineering services provided by the company I work for. 

The goal of this website is to provide information about Smart Associates, and the services it provides. It also provides interactive pages showing some of the projects the company has been involved in and a contact us page. 

This website must be professional for the target audience and contain the information needed to complete the goals of the business owner and site visitors. It must also stand out and be memorable for future visits and for recommendations to other potential users.

### Design Choices

#### Typography

For fonts, I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) for my website. 

I have chosen the font-family: ['Georama'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Georama), sans-serif; for the Headings and Menu sections of the website as it is easy to read and has a nice cursive font which matches the style of the website. I also felt this fitted in well with the design of the website.

#### Colours

For this website I chose a colour pallette that matched similar websites that are professional and clean. The background colour is black, the Nav bar and button text is Navy Blue and menus, some text and buttons are based on the blue and red logo.

The colours I picked are as follows: -

#### Imagery

All images and photographs were selected by the Directors of Smart Associates from several folders of more photographs which were sourced from Alan Vile, Technical Engineer, Smart Associates. **Images will need to be amended before the website goes live as number plates can be seen in some photographs.**

### Icons

Icons were not used on this project

### Layout

This website is designed with access from the home page to all other pages from the navigation bar. The error 404.html page also includes links to other pages, i.e. index.html.

However, the 404.html is not accessed from the navigation bar or from any of the pages of the website. The 404.html page only displays when a user enters or searches for a page that doens't exist. The 404.html page allows the user to navigate to the main website.

[blueprint](docs/ms2-website-layout.pdf) 

This blueprint was then used to design the navigation and call-out buttons featured in the website.
